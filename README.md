# Eric's Advent of Code Solutions

## Introduction

I first learned about Advent of Code in 2020, and I absolutely fell in love with the
event. For me, AoC has proven to be a really excellent tool for learning/practicing
a new programming language. To date, I have used AoC to learn both Rust and Julia. I'll
probably continue this trend in subsequent years as well. I've blogged my approaches
to the [2020](https://www.ericburden.work/categories/advent-of-code-2020/) puzzles in 
R and the [2021](https://www.ericburden.work/categories/advent-of-code-2021/) puzzles
in Julia. During early 2021, I re-solved all the puzzles in Rust. Each blog post
includes not only the code but some commentary on the thinking behind the approach and
my thoughts about the puzzles in general.

After solving the 2021 puzzles in Julia, I decided that I'd like to collect all 350 (as
of 2021) stars from past years. Thus began an ~5 month journey of working on old AoC
puzzles on and off in whatever free time I could scrounge up (from other, honestly more
important things like spending time with family). The [legacy](https://github.com/ericwburden/advent_of_code_legacy) repo contains all the Julia code
I wrote to earn those stars! I can't imagine that I'll try to blog about these, since 
(a) these are old puzzles and not likely to be as interesting to others and (b) that's
a lot of work!

## This Repo

This repo is just a shell for each year's AoC repositories. I've opted (at least for
now) to include each as a submodule here, giving me a lot of flexibility to set up and
use other languages for future years, because I probably will. This way, I can have one
repo per year (notwithstanding the legacy years) and link them all here.

## How's It Going?

I'm all caught up! (As of 2022, at least)
